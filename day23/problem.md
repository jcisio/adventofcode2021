--- Day 23: Amphipod ---
A group of amphipods notice your fancy submarine and flag you down. "With such an impressive shell," one amphipod says, "surely you can help us with a question that has stumped our best scientists."

They go on to explain that a group of timid, stubborn amphipods live in a nearby burrow. Four types of amphipods live there: Amber (A), Bronze (B), Copper (C), and Desert (D). They live in a burrow that consists of a hallway and four side rooms. The side rooms are initially full of amphipods, and the hallway is initially empty.

They give you a diagram of the situation (your puzzle input), including locations of each amphipod (A, B, C, or D, each of which is occupying an otherwise open space), walls (#), and open space (.).

For example:

#############
#...........#
###B#C#B#D###
  #A#D#C#A#
  #########
The amphipods would like a method to organize every amphipod into side rooms so that each side room contains one type of amphipod and the types are sorted A-D going left to right, like this:

#############
#...........#
###A#B#C#D###
  #A#B#C#D#
  #########
Amphipods can move up, down, left, or right so long as they are moving into an unoccupied open space. Each type of amphipod requires a different amount of energy to move one step: Amber amphipods require 1 energy per step, Bronze amphipods require 10 energy, Copper amphipods require 100, and Desert ones require 1000. The amphipods would like you to find a way to organize the amphipods that requires the least total energy.

However, because they are timid and stubborn, the amphipods have some extra rules:

Amphipods will never stop on the space immediately outside any room. They can move into that space so long as they immediately continue moving. (Specifically, this refers to the four open spaces in the hallway that are directly above an amphipod starting position.)
Amphipods will never move from the hallway into a room unless that room is their destination room and that room contains no amphipods which do not also have that room as their own destination. If an amphipod's starting room is not its destination room, it can stay in that room until it leaves the room. (For example, an Amber amphipod will not move from the hallway into the right three rooms, and will only move into the leftmost room if that room is empty or if it only contains other Amber amphipods.)
Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway, it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room. (That is, once any amphipod starts moving, any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place and will not move again until they can move fully into a room.)
In the above example, the amphipods can be organized using a minimum of 12521 energy. One way to do this is shown below.

Starting configuration:

#############
#...........#
###B#C#B#D###
  #A#D#C#A#
  #########
One Bronze amphipod moves into the hallway, taking 4 steps and using 40 energy:

#############
#...B.......#
###B#C#.#D###
  #A#D#C#A#
  #########
The only Copper amphipod not in its side room moves there, taking 4 steps and using 400 energy:

#############
#...B.......#
###B#.#C#D###
  #A#D#C#A#
  #########
A Desert amphipod moves out of the way, taking 3 steps and using 3000 energy, and then the Bronze amphipod takes its place, taking 3 steps and using 30 energy:

#############
#.....D.....#
###B#.#C#D###
  #A#B#C#A#
  #########
The leftmost Bronze amphipod moves to its room using 40 energy:

#############
#.....D.....#
###.#B#C#D###
  #A#B#C#A#
  #########
Both amphipods in the rightmost room move into the hallway, using 2003 energy in total:

#############
#.....D.D.A.#
###.#B#C#.###
  #A#B#C#.#
  #########
Both Desert amphipods move into the rightmost room using 7000 energy:

#############
#.........A.#
###.#B#C#D###
  #A#B#C#D#
  #########
Finally, the last Amber amphipod moves into its room, using 8 energy:

#############
#...........#
###A#B#C#D###
  #A#B#C#D#
  #########
What is the least energy required to organize the amphipods?

--- Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit ---
Magic smoke starts leaking from the submarine's arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Without the ability to perform basic arithmetic and logic functions, the submarine can't produce cool patterns with its Christmas lights!

It also can't navigate. Or run the oxygen system.

Don't worry, though - you probably have enough oxygen left to give you enough time to build a new ALU.

The ALU is a four-dimensional processing unit: it has integer variables w, x, y, and z. These variables all start with the value 0. The ALU also supports six instructions:

inp a - Read an input value and write it to variable a.
add a b - Add the value of a to the value of b, then store the result in variable a.
mul a b - Multiply the value of a by the value of b, then store the result in variable a.
div a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, truncate the result to an integer, then store the result in variable a. (Here, "truncate" means to round the value toward zero.)
mod a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, then store the remainder in variable a. (This is also called the modulo operation.)
eql a b - If the value of a and b are equal, then store the value 1 in variable a. Otherwise, store the value 0 in variable a.
In all of these instructions, a and b are placeholders; a will always be the variable where the result of the operation is stored (one of w, x, y, or z), while b can be either a variable or a number. Numbers can be positive or negative, but will always be integers.

The ALU has no jump instructions; in an ALU program, every instruction is run exactly once in order from top to bottom. The program halts after the last instruction has finished executing.

(Program authors should be especially cautious; attempting to execute div with b=0 or attempting to execute mod with a<0 or b<=0 will cause the program to crash and might even damage the ALU. These operations are never intended in any serious ALU program.)

For example, here is an ALU program which takes an input number, negates it, and stores it in x:

inp x
mul x -1
Here is an ALU program which takes two input numbers, then sets z to 1 if the second input number is three times larger than the first input number, or sets z to 0 otherwise:

inp z
inp x
mul z 3
eql z x
Here is an ALU program which takes a non-negative integer as input, converts it into binary, and stores the lowest (1's) bit in z, the second-lowest (2's) bit in y, the third-lowest (4's) bit in x, and the fourth-lowest (8's) bit in w:

inp w
add z w
mod z 2
div w 2
add y w
mod y 2
div w 2
add x w
mod x 2
div w 2
mod w 2
Once you have built a replacement ALU, you can install it in the submarine, which will immediately resume what it was doing when the ALU failed: validating the submarine's model number. To do this, the ALU will run the MOdel Number Automatic Detector program (MONAD, your puzzle input).

Submarine model numbers are always fourteen-digit numbers consisting only of digits 1 through 9. The digit 0 cannot appear in a model number.

When MONAD checks a hypothetical fourteen-digit model number, it uses fourteen separate inp instructions, each expecting a single digit of the model number in order of most to least significant. (So, to check the model number 13579246899999, you would give 1 to the first inp instruction, 3 to the second inp instruction, 5 to the third inp instruction, and so on.) This means that when operating MONAD, each input instruction should only ever be given an integer value of at least 1 and at most 9.

Then, after MONAD has finished running all of its instructions, it will indicate that the model number was valid by leaving a 0 in variable z. However, if the model number was invalid, it will leave some other non-zero value in z.

MONAD imposes additional, mysterious restrictions on model numbers, and legend says the last copy of the MONAD documentation was eaten by a tanuki. You'll need to figure out what MONAD does some other way.

To enable as many submarine features as possible, find the largest valid fourteen-digit model number that contains no 0 digits. What is the largest model number accepted by MONAD?
